_DARE2PAYITFORWARD_ is a challenge designed to ‘pay forward’ your story through your talents and skills, and measure the social value of our society. At the DARE event 2019, 30.000 coins were spread among Rabobank employees worldwide. The coming months we track the actions and stories, as they travel from Rabobank employees to citizens across the globe. 


_‘Pay it Forward’_: when you tell your story, and pass on an action that contributes to society and pass on the DARE-token to someone else. Paying it forward creates a constructive chain reaction that cumulates in a significant positive impact on society. What you chose to do, is completely up to you. It is your chance to make a change.
