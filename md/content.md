WHY 
Rabobank’s mission statement is ‘Growing A Better World Together’. We believe that, in the transformation of the bank, everyone has a role to play. Together, as one Rabo, we can contribute to a better society. Therefore, Rabobank invited studio Elise Marcus to develop the DARE2PAYITFORWARD project.

PAYITFORWARD
‘Pay it Forward’: when you tell your story, and pass on an action that contributes to society and pass on the DARE-token to someone else. Paying it forward creates a constructive chain reaction that cumulates in a significant positive impact on society. What you chose to do, is completely up to you. It is your chance to make a change.

DARE2PAYITFORWARD 
DARE2PAYITFORWARD is a challenge designed to ‘pay forward’ your story through your talents and skills, and measure the social value of our society. At the DARE event 2019, 30.000 coins were spread among Rabobank employees worldwide. The coming months we track the actions and stories, as they travel from Rabobank employees to citizens across the globe. 

DARE: 
At DARE, we focus on initiatives that can turn our mission into a reality. Let’s make sure the ‘Pay it Forward’ message spreads throughout our worldwide community. To spread the message, you pass on your DARE-tokens to a colleague, friend or neighbour. Stand out in the crowd, own your role as a thought leader and change maker, and ‘Pay it Forward’.
