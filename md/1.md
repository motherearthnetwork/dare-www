Rabobank’s mission statement is _‘Growing A Better World Together’_. We believe that, in the transformation of the bank, everyone has a role to play. Together, as one Rabo, we can contribute to a better society. Therefore, Rabobank invited studio Elise Marcus to develop the DARE2PAYITFORWARD project.
